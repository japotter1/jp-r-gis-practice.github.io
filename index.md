# GIS Portfolio

Jada Potter - Updated 4/26/23

Welcome! This repository contains a selection of GIS work I have completed for various classes at the University of Chicago. Though I began by only uploading maps based on work I had done in R, I later included an ArcGIS Online map, a couple of R Markdown files, two PDFs of term papers that relied at least partially on GIS analysis, and three map figures made in QGIS.

All work in this repository is my own. Please note, however, that the name I use in some of the files is a name I no longer go by.
